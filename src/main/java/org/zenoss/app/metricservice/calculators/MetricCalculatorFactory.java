/**
 * Factory class to dynamically create instances of metric expression evaluation
 * engines based on a simplified URI specification. The URI specification is
 * essentially the expression language, followed by a colon, followed by an
 * intial expression.
 * 
 * If the initial expression is ommited, the colon can be ommited as well.
 * 
 * The implementation of the expression language calculated is dynamically
 * created by using a well known class name, Calculator, located in a subpackage
 * the shares the name of the expression language, i.e. if the expression
 * language is 'rpn', then the implementation class will be 'rpn.Calculator'.
 * 
 * The implementation class is searched for as a sub-package under the packages
 * specified in the system property
 * 'org.zenoss.app.metricservice.calculator.path'. This property contains a list
 * of base package names separated by a colons. The default path is the single
 * entry 'org.zenoss.app.metricservice.calculators'.
